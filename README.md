# Datasets and some snippets  ðŸ’«


In this repository I store dataframes and small scripts to support the teaching of *Biostatistics I* and *Biostatistics II*. 

If you encounter/find an error or can adjust the script more optimally, please let me know. I will be glad. You can reach me at rost@fzt.jcu.cz

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(ggplot2)
```
