# Datasets and some snippets


In this repository I store data files and small scripts to support the teaching of Biostatistics I and Biostatistics II. If you encounter/find an error or can adjust the script more optimally, please let me know. I will be glad. You can reach me at rost@ztf.jcu.cz or rost@retorta.cz
